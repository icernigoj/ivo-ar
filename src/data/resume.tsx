  summary:
    `👨‍💻 **Fullstack developer & tech lead** with **12+ years** building web and mobile applications that people actually use.

I enjoy working with diverse tech stacks - **React/React Native**, **Node.js**, **NestJS**, **Next.js** and **PHP/Symfony**. What really drives me is creating end-to-end solutions from scratch, with a strong focus on product design and working closely with clients to understand their needs.

🔧 **Recently, I've been working on some interesting challenges:**

- At **LCL**, I'm tech lead on a team building a complex KYB/KYC platform from scratch for one of France's major banks - orchestrating 15+ integrations with compliance databases (Banque de France, Pappers, World-Check) while ensuring code quality and regulatory compliance in a highly demanding environment.

- At **Colas**, I had the opportunity to be tech lead on a team maintaining 5 different operational applications - from supply chain management to public-facing construction site tracking. It taught me a lot about juggling multiple priorities and keeping critical systems running smoothly.

- Created the entire tech infrastructure for **FlyLooping**, a travel startup where users can book multi-city European tours with optimized flight combinations.

I'm always curious about new technologies, but I believe the best solutions come from understanding user needs first, then choosing the right tools for the job. I try to keep things pragmatic and team-oriented, focusing on delivering solutions that actually work for the people who use them.`,

    introduction: `I started playing piano when I was 10 years old. Over the years, I've built up a repertoire spanning from **Bach** and **Mozart** to **Chopin**, **Liszt**, and **Rachmaninov**.

Music has always been a counterbalance to my work in tech - a different kind of discipline that requires patience, practice, and emotional expression. I particularly enjoy the **Romantic period** composers, with Chopin being my favorite.`,
